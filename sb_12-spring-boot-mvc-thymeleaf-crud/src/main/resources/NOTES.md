# SpringBoot: RESTful Service with Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA and Thymeleaf

## Difference between @Controller and @RestController in Spring Boot

Both `@Controller` and `@RestController` are annotations used in Spring Boot to define classes that handle HTTP requests. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:

### @Controller

- The `@Controller` annotation is used to mark a class as a controller in Spring MVC.
- Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests and generating HTTP responses.
- Methods within a `@Controller` class typically return the name of a view to render, which is resolved by a ViewResolver to generate HTML content.
- By default, methods in a `@Controller` class are annotated with `@ResponseBody`, indicating that the return value should be serialized to the HTTP response body, typically as HTML.

### @RestController

- The `@RestController` annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller` that is used to create RESTful web services.
- Unlike `@Controller`, `@RestController` is intended for scenarios where the HTTP response body should be serialized directly to the HTTP response, typically as JSON or XML.
- Methods within a `@RestController` class automatically serialize the return value to JSON or XML using Spring's `HttpMessageConverter` mechanism.
- When a method in a `@RestController` class returns an object, Spring Boot automatically serializes it to the appropriate format (JSON or XML) and includes it in the HTTP response body.

In summary, while both `@Controller` and `@RestController` are used to handle HTTP requests, `@RestController` is specifically tailored for building RESTful APIs and automatically serializes method return values to the HTTP response body, making it more suitable for building web services.
